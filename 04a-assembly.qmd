## Assembling reads
The assembly process groups reads into contigs and contigs into 
scaffolds to obtain (ideally) the sequence of a whole 
chromosome. There are many programs devoted to
[genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2874646/) and 
metagenome assembly, some of the main strategies they use are Greedy extension, OLC, and De Bruijn charts. 
Contrary to metabarcoding, shotgun metagenomics needs an assembly step, which does not mean that metabarcoding never uses an assembly step but sometimes is unnecessary.

![Overview of Different Methods of Genome Assembly](fig/04a-01.png)

[MetaSPAdes](https://github.com/ablab/spades) is an NGS de novo assembler 
for assembling large and complex metagenomics data, and it is one of the 
most used and recommended. It is part of the SPAdes toolkit, which 
contains several assembly pipelines.

Some of the problems faced by metagenomics assembly are:  
* Differences in coverage between the genomes due to the differences in abundance in the sample.  
* The fact that different species often share conserved regions.  
* The presence of several strains of a single species in the community.   

SPAdes already deals with the non-uniform coverage problem in its algorithm, so it is helpful for the assembly of simple communities, 
but the [metaSPAdes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28298430/) algorithm deals with the other problems as well, allowing it to assemble metagenomes from complex communities. 

The process of (metagenomics) assembly can take a long time, therefore we will usea subset of our data for this step.

FROM TUTORIAL


SPAdes genome assembler v3.15.0 [metaSPAdes mode]

Usage: spades.py [options] -o <output_dir>

Basic options:
  -o <output_dir>             directory to store all the resulting files (required)
  --iontorrent                this flag is required for IonTorrent data
  --test                      runs SPAdes on a toy dataset
  -h, --help                  prints this usage message
  -v, --version               prints version

Input data:
  --12 <filename>             file with interlaced forward and reverse paired-end reads
  -1 <filename>               file with forward paired-end reads
  -2 <filename>               file with reverse paired-end reads

## MetaSPAdes is a metagenomics assembler

The help we just saw tells us how to run `metaspades.py`. We are going 
to use the most straightforward options, just specifying our forward paired-end 
reads with `-1` and reverse paired-end reads with `-2`, and the output 
directory where we want our results to be stored. 
 ~~~
$ cd ~/dc_workshop/data/trimmed_fastq
$ metaspades.py -1 JC1A_R1.trim.fastq.gz -2 JC1A_R2.trim.fastq.gz -o ../../results/assembly_JC1A
~~~
{: .bash}

Now that it is running we should detach our screen with `control + a` `d` and wait for a few minutes while it running. And then attach the screen with 
`screen -r assembly` to see how it went.  

When the run is finished, it shows this message:

~~~
======= SPAdes pipeline finished.

SPAdes log can be found here: /home/dcuser/dc_workshop/results/assembly_JC1A/spades.log

Thank you for using SPAdes!

~~~
{: .bash}
Now we can kill the screen with `exit` and look at our results in the main screen.

Now, let's go to the output files: 
~~~
$ cd ../../results/assembly_JC1A
$ ls -F
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
assembly_graph_after_simplification.gfa  corrected/              K55/             scaffolds.fasta
assembly_graph.fastg                     dataset.info            misc/            scaffolds.paths

contigs.fasta                            K21/                    run_spades.sh    tmp/
contigs.paths                            K33/                    run_spades.yaml   
~~~
{: .output}

As we can see, MetaSPAdes gave us a lot of files. The ones with the assembly are the `contigs.fasta` and the `scaffolds.fasta`. 
Also, we found three `K` folders: _K21, K33, and K55_; this contains the individual result files for an assembly 
with k-mers equal to those numbers: 21, 33, and 55. The best-assembled results are 
the ones that are displayed outside these k-folders. The folder `corrected` hold the corrected reads 
with the SPAdes algorithm. Moreover, the file 
`assembly_graph_with_scaffolds.gfa` have the information needed to visualize 
our assembly by different means, like programs such as [Bandage](https://rrwick.github.io/Bandage/).

The contigs are just made from assembled reads, but the scaffolds are the result 
from a subsequent process in which the contigs are ordered, oriented, and connected with Ns.

We can recognize which sample our assembly outputs corresponds to because they are inside 
the assembly results folder: `assembly_JC1A/`. However, the files within it do not have the 
sample ID. If we need the files out of their folder, it is beneficial to rename them.

> ## Exercise 1: Rename all files in a folder (needed in the next episode)
>
> Add the prefix `JC1A` (the sample ID) separated by a `_` to the beginning of the names of all the contents in the `assembly_JC1A/` directory. Remember that many solutions are possible.
> 
> A) `$ mv * JC1A_`    
> B) `$ mv * JC1A_*`    
> C) `$ for name in *; do mv $name JC1A_; done`      
> D) `$ for name in *; do mv $name JC1A_$name; done`      
>    
>> ## Solution
>>
>>  A)  No, this option is going to give you as error `mv: target 'JC1A_' is not a directory` 
>>  This is because `mv` has two options:  
>>  `mv file_1 file_2`  
>>  `mv file_1, file_2, ..... file_n directory`   
>>  When a list of files is passed to `mv`, the `mv` expects the last parameters to be a directory.  
>>  Here, `*` gives you a list of all the files in the directory. The last parameter is `JC1A_` (which `mv` expects to be a directory).   
>>  B)  No. Again, every file is sent to the same file.  
>>  C)  No, every file is sent to the same file JC1A_  
>>  D)  Yes, this is one of the possible solutions.  
>> 
>> Â¿Do you have another solution?

> ## Exercise 2: Compare two fasta files from the assembly output 
> You want to know how many contigs and scaffolds result from the assembly. 
> Use `contigs.fasta`  and `scaffolds.fasta ` files and sort the commands to create correct code lines.   
> Do they have the same number of lines? Why?  
> **Hint**: You can use the following commands: `grep`, `|` (pipe), `-l`, `">"`, `wc`, `filename.fasta`
> 
>> ## Solution
>> 
>> ~~~
>> $ grep '>' contigs.fasta | wc -l
>> $ grep '>' scaffolds.fasta | wc -l
>> ~~~
>> {: .bash}
>>
>> A contig is created from reads and then a scaffold from a group of contigs, so we expect fewer lines in the `scaffolds.fasta ` .

> ## Quality of assemblies
> You can use several metrics to know the quality of your assemblies. [MetaQuast](https://quast.sourceforge.net/metaquast.html) is a program
>  that gives you these metrics for metagenome assemblies in an interactive report and text files and plots.
